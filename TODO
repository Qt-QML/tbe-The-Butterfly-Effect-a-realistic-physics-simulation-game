ROADMAP FOR THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT
================================

Milestone 1 - Bowling for Butterflies
COMPLETED: Subversion revision 101
Features:
  x Object model implemented, OpenDE implemented
  x Implemented modelling for:
    x Ramp
    x BowlingBall
    x BowlingPin
  x Hardcoded level, where the bowling ball falls on the ramp
    speeds up, runs over a horizontal part and kicks over the pin
    which flies away
  x MainWindow displays and the above simulation is shown
    in the GraphicsView using circles and/or rectangles
  x Start button works, stop button works, 
  x Reset button works.
  x Timing is correct.
  x Fix objects to Z=0 plane
  x Bouncing is more-or-less correct
NOT A PLAYABLE GAME


Milestone 2 - Levelling the Lands
COMPLETED: Subversion revision 143
Features:
  x Implement models for:
    - Floor (horizontal, not bouncy)
    - Wall  (vertical, bouncy)
  x write two Levels in XML by hand
    - one of them is the above simple bowling
    - the other one is a more complex level with multiple floors
  x Implement level class and parse XML file to objects
  x menu File>Open works
  x implement moving of objects within GraphicsView
    x the actual moving of a single object
    x moves must be persistent (i.e. start-stop-reset should remember the new position)
    x if start button says continue (i.e. sim has run but not yet reset), 
      it should not be possible to move objects around
  x implement UNDO feature
  x centering on play field is automated
  x loading a new level works correctly and removes previous level 
    x start-stop-continue-reset is reset as well
  x add splash screen
NOT A PLAYABLE GAME


Milestone 3 - Dragging along
COMPLETED: Subversion revision 334
Features:
  x Switch from OpenDE (3D physics library) to Box2D (2D graphics library)
  x implement Drag&Drop from toolchest to GraphicsView
  x Allow saving of view into XML File (i.e. "saved game")
  x implement post-its
  x implement volleyball
  X implement coke-mentos-bottle
	x implement contacts/sensors
	x actual bottle trigger
	x implement callback interface per simstep
	x figure out how to draw the liquid color differently over time
	x figure out how to model the splatter - separate class???
	x remove cap after blowing starts
  x i18n of application
	x GUI
	x NoteIt
  x right-mouse button + anchors to adjust properties (e.g. resize, rotate, trapdoor threshold)
	x implement RMB menu
	  x delete
	x add anchors around object
	x actually implement hori/verti resize
  x make simulation speed adjustable:  1/4x 1/2x 1x (2x)
  x redo DrawObject to allow for arbitrarily scaled square objects, automatically splitting it up
	in multiple Box2D objects if needed
	x rewrite Wall object - removed - use RectObject now :-)
	x rewrite Floor object
  x use "not found" image placeholder
  x add current directory to list of dirs searched by ImageStore
NOT REALLY A PLAYABLE GAME

Milestone 4 - Getting ready for prime time
Completed: revision 420.
  / implement foreground/background scenery images
	* layering is not selectable yet
  x add images & animation
	x all images in SVG or PNG format (implemented in milestone 3 already)
	x all images are scaled to fit their outline (implemented in milestone 3 already)
  x add difference between play mode and level editor
	* currently only switchable from src/main.cpp and a recompile
  x split level between pre-defined objects and toolbox available objects
	x definition of XML for config file
	x parsing of XML for config file
	x drag-drop of RectObject derived goes OK
	x decrease available object count in toolbox on successful Drag&Drop
  x create all levels for ELCE
	* use round_coconut.svg as image for coconut instead of BowlingBall.
  x add choose level dialog
FIRST PLAYABLE - with a supervisor


Milestone 5 - It's make over time! (NLLGG talk)
COMPLETED: revision 556
  x Important overdue refactorings:
	x refactor UndoMoveCommand/DrawObject
	x Create AbstractBall class and merge BowlingBall and Volleyball into that
  x add concept of "winning" a level
	x for proximity (butterfly close to flower)
	x for change of parameter (object moved/toppled)
  x add concept of order in levels, so players can start
	x make the dialog modal - no way around it!
	x add File>Open Custom...
	x make it flexible: allow more than one directory with levels
	x mark levels as "done"
  x make start-stop-reset more intuitive
	x use stopwatch animated image
	x hook the stopwatch class to drawworld (if no drawworld, no stopwatch)
  x make sure butterfly dies if hit by something
	x also terminate simulation in that case
  x add Tennisball object
  x add two more levels (actually more than two :-)
  x make collision detection on mouse move better/more usable
  x if collision happens and user releases mouse button, go back to last known good.
  x generalize collision detection so it also works with CokeMentosBottle
  x honor "resizable" property
  x highlight NoteIts on hovering over them
    x also set cursor to PointingHand shape - for any selectable item
  x add icon to program
  x build script to release
  x Shrink bounding rectangles on RightRamp and LeftRamp
  x if level started from command line, do not display splash screen
FIRST WIDELY ANNOUNCEABLE VERSION


Milestone 6 - inbetween
NOTE: As of the end of Milestone 5, we now have TRAC on Sourceforge to handle the action items for a release.
So this list will dimnish in usability and contents over time as line items migrate into TRAC.
  * clicking on anything not movable (or clicking on nothing) should remove the anchors from the currently selected.
  / PERFORMANCE: 	setCacheMode(QGraphicsItem::ItemCoordinateCache);
	- would be nice - indeed improves performance but deteriorates gfx quality
	x I implemented custom cache sizes - but that kills QT :-(
	- so it is disabled again
  * finish i18n of application
	* Level Name
	* Level Description
  * i18n of levels
  * implement more objects
	- penguin, herring ?   (or cat - mouse - cheese?)
	- granite block
	- trap door
	- gummi ball
	- Truck (i.e. with space to put something on that needs moving).
  * RMB actions
	- adjust properties


Later milestones
  * finish level editor
  * investigate GLUON again
  * wheel
  * balloons
  * add corresponding more levels
  * validate order of all levels
  * zooming (like World Of Goo)
  * obsessive completion criteria?
  * storyline
  * beautify everything, custom graphics and such
  * audio?
  * packaging: add installers
  * MacOSX version?
  * Windows version
  * bugfixing
  * liquid
