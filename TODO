ROADMAP FOR THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT
================================

Milestone 1 - Bowling for Butterflies
COMPLETED: Subversion revision 101
Features:
  x Object model implemented, OpenDE implemented
  x Implemented modelling for:
    x Ramp
    x BowlingBall
    x BowlingPin
  x Hardcoded level, where the bowling ball falls on the ramp
    speeds up, runs over a horizontal part and kicks over the pin
    which flies away
  x MainWindow displays and the above simulation is shown
    in the GraphicsView using circles and/or rectangles
  x Start button works, stop button works, 
  x Reset button works.
  x Timing is correct.
  x Fix objects to Z=0 plane
  x Bouncing is more-or-less correct
NOT A PLAYABLE GAME


Milestone 2 - Levelling the Lands
COMPLETED: Subversion revision 143
Features:
  x Implement models for:
    - Floor (horizontal, not bouncy)
    - Wall  (vertical, bouncy)
  x write two Levels in XML by hand
    - one of them is the above simple bowling
    - the other one is a more complex level with multiple floors
  x Implement level class and parse XML file to objects
  x menu File>Open works
  x implement moving of objects within GraphicsView
    x the actual moving of a single object
    x moves must be persistent (i.e. start-stop-reset should remember the new position)
    x if start button says continue (i.e. sim has run but not yet reset), 
      it should not be possible to move objects around
  x implement UNDO feature
  x centering on play field is automated
  x loading a new level works correctly and removes previous level 
    x start-stop-continue-reset is reset as well
  x add splash screen
NOT A PLAYABLE GAME


Milestone 3 - Dragging along
COMPLETED: Subversion revision 334
Features:
  x Switch from OpenDE (3D physics library) to Box2D (2D graphics library)
  x implement Drag&Drop from toolchest to GraphicsView
  x Allow saving of view into XML File (i.e. "saved game")
  x implement post-its
  x implement volleyball
  X implement coke-mentos-bottle
	x implement contacts/sensors
	x actual bottle trigger
	x implement callback interface per simstep
	x figure out how to draw the liquid color differently over time
	x figure out how to model the splatter - separate class???
	x remove cap after blowing starts
  x i18n of application
	x GUI
	x NoteIt
  x right-mouse button + anchors to adjust properties (e.g. resize, rotate, trapdoor threshold)
	x implement RMB menu
	  x delete
	x add anchors around object
	x actually implement hori/verti resize
  x make simulation speed adjustable:  1/4x 1/2x 1x (2x)
  x redo DrawObject to allow for arbitrarily scaled square objects, automatically splitting it up
	in multiple Box2D objects if needed
	x rewrite Wall object - removed - use RectObject now :-)
	x rewrite Floor object
  x use "not found" image placeholder
  x add current directory to list of dirs searched by ImageStore
NOT REALLY A PLAYABLE GAME

Milestone 4 - Getting ready for prime time
Completed: revision 420.
  / implement foreground/background scenery images
	* layering is not selectable yet
  x add images & animation
	x all images in SVG or PNG format (implemented in milestone 3 already)
	x all images are scaled to fit their outline (implemented in milestone 3 already)
  x add difference between play mode and level editor
	* currently only switchable from src/main.cpp and a recompile
  x split level between pre-defined objects and toolbox available objects
	x definition of XML for config file
	x parsing of XML for config file
	x drag-drop of RectObject derived goes OK
	x decrease available object count in toolbox on successful Drag&Drop
  x create all levels for ELCE
	* use round_coconut.svg as image for coconut instead of BowlingBall.
  x add choose level dialog
FIRST PLAYABLE - with a supervisor


Milestone 5 - It's make over time! (post-ELCE)
Version 0.50
  * implement rotation of relevant objects
	- requires implementing UndoRotateCommand
  / Important overdue refactorings:
	- Merge BaseObject and RectObject
	x refactor UndoMoveCommand/DrawObject
	- re-add collision detection for user added objects (=regression from above refactoring)
	x Create AbstractBall class and merge BowlingBall and Volleyball into that
  / add concept of "winning" a level
	x for proximity (butterfly close to flower)
	- for change of parameter (object moved/toppled)
  / add concept of order in levels, so players can start
	and then move on without having to use File>Open (currently buggy)
  * make sure butterfly dies if hit by something
  x add Tennisball object
  * add two more levels
FIRST WIDELY ANNOUNCEABLE VERSION


Milestone 5.5 - inbetween
  * investigate GLUON
  * Important overdue refactorings:
	* switching to Gluon may solve this already?
	- split Position into Vector and Position, where Position is (Vector + angle)
  * do not (re)paint objects that are sleeping
	* switching to Gluon may solve this already
	- is this actually happening?
	- set all objects to sleep at clicking "start" and reset the sleep status at reset?
  * solve Volleyball/VolleyBall issues
	this involves splitting between technical name and visible name ?!?
  * automated regression tests for XML parser/world builder
  * finish i18n of application
	* Level Name
	* Level Description
  * zooming
  * persistency (popup warnings, settings, user progress)
  * user configurable settings (display scenery or not, zoom follows objects, animate postits, automatically load/save)
  * i18n of levels
  * implement more objects
	- penguin, herring ?
	- granite block
	- cylinder (rolls horizontally) - allows for see-saw and stone-age carts - yet another ball actually
	- trap door
	- soccer ball / gummi ball
  * improve existing 9 levels and add 10 more
	- make sure to have some basic tutorials
  * RMB actions
	- adjust properties


Milestone 6 - Rope
Version 0.60
  * implement moving multiple objects (rubber band used right)
  * rope
  * skyhooks
  * wheel
  * block hooks so you can tie a block to a rope
  * balloons
  * add corresponding more levels
  * Windows version

Milestone 7 - Finishing Touches
Version 1.0
  * validate order of all levels
  * obsessive completion criteria?
  * storyline?
  * beautify everything, custom graphics and such
  * audio?
  * packaging: add installers
  * MacOSX version?
  * bugfixing




Milestone 8 - etc
Version 1.1
  * liquid
etc
