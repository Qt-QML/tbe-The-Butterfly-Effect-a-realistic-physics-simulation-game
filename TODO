ROADMAP FOR THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT
================================

Milestone 1 - Bowling for Butterflies
COMPLETED: Subversion revision 101
Features:
  x Object model implemented, OpenDE implemented
  x Implemented modelling for:
    x Ramp
    x BowlingBall
    x BowlingPin
  x Hardcoded level, where the bowling ball falls on the ramp
    speeds up, runs over a horizontal part and kicks over the pin
    which flies away
  x MainWindow displays and the above simulation is shown
    in the GraphicsView using circles and/or rectangles
  x Start button works, stop button works, 
  x Reset button works.
  x Timing is correct.
  x Fix objects to Z=0 plane
  x Bouncing is more-or-less correct
NOT A PLAYABLE GAME


Milestone 2 - Levelling the Lands
Version 0.20
Features:
  x Implement models for:
    - Floor (horizontal, not bouncy)
    - Wall  (vertical, bouncy)
  x write two Levels in XML by hand
    - one of them is the above simple bowling
    - the other one is a more complex level with multiple floors
  x Implement level class and parse XML file to objects
  * do not (re)paint objects that have not moved
  x menu File>Open works
  / implement moving of objects within GraphicsView
    x the actual moving of a single object
    / rubber banding - moving multiple objects
    - moves must be persistent (i.e. start-stop-reset should remember the new position)
    x if start button says continue (i.e. sim has run but not yet reset), 
      it should not be possible to move objects around
  x centering on play field is automated
  / loading a new level works correctly and removes previous level 
    - start-stop-continue-reset is reset as well
NOT A PLAYABLE GAME


Milestone 3 - Dragging along
Version 0.30
Features:
  * implement Drag&Drop from toolchest to GraphicsView
  * Allow saving of view into XML File
  * implement post-its
  * i18n
  * right-mouse button to adjust properties (e.g. resize, rotate, trapdoor threshold)
    - implement as a "pie menu"
  * automated regression tests for XML parser/world builder
NOT REALLY A PLAYABLE GAME

Milestone 4 - Size does matter
Version 0.40
  * implement sizing of some objects (e.g. ramp)
  * implement trap door
  * implement styrofoam block
  * implement soccer ball and gummi ball
  * split level between pre-defined objects and tool chest available objects
    - a checkmark sign on the drawing?
  * add 8 more levels
  * add difference between play mode and level editor
  * add concept of "winning" a level
FIRST PLAYABLE (but probably very dumb looking)

Milestone 5 - It's make over time!
Version 0.50
  * commission a logo
  * add splash screen (reading in all images will take a while)
  * add images & animation
    - all images in SVG format ?!?
    - make decision about how to do scaling
  * zooming
  * implement more objects
    - penguin, herring ?
	- butterfly, flower ?
    - granite block
    - cylinder (rolls horizontally) - allows for see-saw and stone-age carts
  * implement foreground/background scenery images
  * improve existing 10 levels and add 10 more
    - make sure to have some basic tutorials
  * add concept of order in levels, so players can start
    and then move on without having to use File>Open
  * persistency (popup warnings, settings, user progress)
  * user configurable settings (display scenery or not, zoom follows objects, animate postits, automatically load/save)
FIRST WIDELY ANNOUNCEABLE VERSION

Milestone 6 - Rope
Version 0.60
  * rope
  * skyhooks
  * wheel
  * block hooks so you can tie a block to a rope
