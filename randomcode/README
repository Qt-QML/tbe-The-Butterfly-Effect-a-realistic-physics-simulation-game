This directory contains code that was used to understand pieces of the 
programming - as such, you'll find code snippets from various Qt projects 
and OpenDE examples here. All of them slightly modified to understand how
things work.

As such, this directory probably is interesting only to Klaas, not to anyone else.
It will probably vanish after the first public release.
