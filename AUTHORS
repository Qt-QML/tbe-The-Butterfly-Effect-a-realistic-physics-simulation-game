The Butterfly Effect
====================

Project Management:
* lspacenl@gmail.com   - Peter van Ginneken

Development:
* 'kaa-ching' - klaas@opentux.nl - Klaas van Gend
* many contributors submitted a few fixes
* macosx port monitored and maintained by 'martian'.
The Butterfly Effect is a happy user of the Box2D and QT libraries.

Graphics:
* many graphics were borrowed or adapted from the web.
  In all directories that contain graphics,  there should be a README listing the origins.
  Note that many images are sourced from openclipart.org and are under a PD license.
  Some images (e.g. Pingus) are under a GPLv3+ license.

Levels:
* quite a few levels were designed by 'Wuzzy'
* many other levels were implemented by Klaas van Gend
  - but many contain ideas coined by others - thank you!
  - almost all levels have seen playtesting by a lot of volunteers - thank you!

Internationalization or "i18n":
* The original English and Dutch texts by Peter and Klaas
* Translation to other languages is now done through "Transifex".
  This project was started and managed by Alexey Loginov. See
