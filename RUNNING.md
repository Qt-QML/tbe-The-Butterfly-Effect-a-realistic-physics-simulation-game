Running The Butterfly Effect
============================

Windows
-------
* Start `tbe.exe` in the Start Menu

GNU/Linux
---------

The application can be run from the command line:

    ./tbe

If you used an installer, it can also be run through the Desktop shortcut.

If you want TBE to run in a different language (and the support is present)
you can force this by typing this:

    LANGUAGE="nl" ./tbe

TBE accepts command-line arguments. Type in `.tbe --help` to get a list
of command-line arguments.
