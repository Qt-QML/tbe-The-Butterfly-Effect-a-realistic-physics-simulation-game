Running The Butterfly Effect
============================

Windows:
--------
* start `tbe.exe` in the Start Menu.


Linux:
------

The application can be run from the command line:
    ./tbe

If you used an installer, it can also be run through the Desktop shortcut.

If you want TBE to run in a different language (and the support is present)
you can force this by typing this:
    LANGUAGE="nl" ./tbe



At the moment, TBE accepts the following command line arguments:
  --help              gives this help text
  -h                  gives this help text
  --verbosity <lvl>   set verbosity, 1=little, 6=max 
  -v <lvl>            set verbosity
  --windowed          display in a window (default is fullscreen)
  -W                  display in a window
