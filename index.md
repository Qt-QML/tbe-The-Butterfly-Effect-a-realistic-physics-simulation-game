![Welcome to The Butterfly Effect](images/web-title_page.png)


The Butterfly Effect is a free and open source game that uses realistic physics simulations to combine lots of simple mechanical elements to achieve a simple goal in the most complex way possible.

This is a fully playable game of alpha quality, well on its way to a shiny 1.0 release. For anyone who has played earlier versions of the game, you'll notice a shiny new user interface - but the same levels and objects.

### Features

 * Works on Linux and Windows
 * Playable in English, Dutch, Spanish, Russian and Malay

### Download, install & play

We are working on getting packages for major Linux-distributions as well as a Windows-installer.

There are 45 levels. All levels are playable, but a few levels may need a bit more polish.

### Open Source

This game is released under the GPLv2 license.
