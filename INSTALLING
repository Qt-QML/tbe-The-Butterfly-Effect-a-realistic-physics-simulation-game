The Butterfly Effect - INSTALLING
=================================


How to build:


1)
Make sure that you have all tools & libraries installed that you need.
These include:
  * gcc
  * qt        (which must be QT version 4.4 or higher)
  * qt-devel


2)
build everything in 3rdParty:
 - make -C 3rdParty


3)
build the main project
 - qmake
 - make


That's it for now!
