The Butterfly Effect - INSTALLING
=================================


How to build:


1)
Make sure that you have all tools & libraries installed that you need.
These include:
  * gcc, glibc-devel, make
  * autoconf, automake
  * libqt4        (which must be QT version 4.4 or higher)
  * libqt4-devel
  * probably a significant of dependencies of the above

2)
build everything in 3rdParty:
 - make -C 3rdParty
(don't worry, this will be integrated into the make of step 3 at some point)

3)
build the main project
 - qmake
 - make


That's it for now!
