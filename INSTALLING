The Butterfly Effect - INSTALLING
=================================


How to build:


1)
Make sure that you have all tools & libraries installed that you need.
These include:
  * gcc, glibc-devel
  * make
  * (autoconf, automake)
  * libqt4        (which must be QT version 4.4 or higher)
  * libqt4-devel
  * patch
  * you probably will have to install more packages than the above list
    because they have dependencies - make sure to install these as well.


2)
As a *NORMAL* user, build the main project. 
Note that the below configure is not autotools based,
it is just a bash script setting up the Box2d libraries and the images.
    $   chmod u+x configure
    $   ./configure
    $   make

4)
How to run:
    $   ./tbe
    
There is no need to install anything - it will run from its working directory.
If you really want, there is a script to build a tar archive with the minimum number
of files you need to play...

That's it for now!
Have fun!
