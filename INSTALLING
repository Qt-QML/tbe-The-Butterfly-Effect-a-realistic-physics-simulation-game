The Butterfly Effect - INSTALLING
=================================


How to build:


1)
Make sure that you have all tools & libraries installed that you need.
These include:
  * gcc, glibc-devel
  * binutils
  * make
  * (autoconf, automake)
  * patch
Depending on whether you have these:
  * libqt4        (which must be QT version 4.4 or higher)
  * libqt4-devel
if you do not, you'll need to build the static version, which in turn
requires building QT first - you'll now also need:
  * a lot of X11 development libraries
  * wget
However, doing a static build is beyond the scope of this document, 
please refer to the TBE wiki.


2)
As a *NORMAL* user, build the main project. 
Note that the below configure is not autotools based,
it is just a bash script setting up the Box2d libraries and the images.
    $   chmod u+x configure
    $   ./configure
    $   make


3)
If you want to run TBE in another language (note: only Dutch 'nl' is i
supported right now) you need to do the following:
    $   lupdate tbe.pro
    $   lrelease tbe.pro

4)
How to run:
    $   ./tbe
    
There is no need to install anything - it will run from its working directory.

That's it for now!
Have fun!
