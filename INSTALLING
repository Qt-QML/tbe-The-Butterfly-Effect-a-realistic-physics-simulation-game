The Butterfly Effect - INSTALLING
=================================

If you downloaded an installer and executed it, being able to read
this file already suggests you're done - the installer did its work.

This file explains step-by-step how to build TBE from the source archive.

1)
Make sure that you have all tools & libraries installed that you need.
These include:
  * gcc, glibc-devel
  * binutils
  * make
  * cmake
  * patch
Depending on whether you have these:
  * libqt4        (which must be QT version 4.4 - 4.6 !!!)
  * libqt4-devel
if you do not, you'll need to build the static version, which in turn
requires building QT first - you'll now also need:
  * a lot of X11 development libraries
  * wget
However, doing a static build is beyond the scope of this document, 
please refer to the TBE wiki:
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/tbe/wiki/HowToMakeARelease


2)
As a *NORMAL* user, build the main project. 
If you have cmake installed, this should be as easy as just run make in this
directory:
    make
That make will in turn call cmake and build everything for you.
It will also immediately install the game in the local directory.

3)
If you want to run TBE in another language (note: only Dutch 'nl' and Spanish
'es' are supported right now) you need to do the following:
    make lang
This will update the translation files, so TBE can use them.

4)
There is no action four :-)
Enjoy!
