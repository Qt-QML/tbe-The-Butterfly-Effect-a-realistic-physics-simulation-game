The Butterfly Effect - INSTALLING
=================================


How to build:


1)
Make sure that you have all tools & libraries installed that you need.
These include:
  * gcc, glibc-devel
  * make
  * (autoconf, automake)
  * libqt4        (which must be QT version 4.4 or higher)
  * libqt4-devel
  * patch
  * you probably will have to install more packages than the above list
    because they have dependencies - make sure to install these as well.


2)
As a *NORMAL* user, build everything in 3rdParty:
    $   make -C 3rdParty
(don't worry, this will be integrated into the make of step 3 at some point)

3)
As a *NORMAL* user, build the main project:
    $   qmake
    $   make

4)
How to run:
    $   ./tbe
    
    

That's it for now!
