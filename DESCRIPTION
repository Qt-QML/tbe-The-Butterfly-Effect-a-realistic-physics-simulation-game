The Butterfly Effect is a fully playable physics puzzle game of alpha quality,
well on its way to a shiny 1.0 release. 

The goal of the game is to complete a scene with extra objects to achieve the
goal, which can vary from bringing a butterfly to its flower, toppling a
bowling pin or popping a balloon - just to make a few.

There are 45 levels.
All levels are playable, a few levels may need a bit more polish.

We would love to hear your thoughts and comments about the game!
