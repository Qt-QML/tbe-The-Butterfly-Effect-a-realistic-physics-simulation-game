Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", Milestone 6.

This is a fully playable game, but no yet completely finished.

There are 26 levels.
All levels are playable, some levels may need a bit more polish.

You need to have at least QT 4.4 installed to run the game.

New features & highlights in Milestone 6:
    * finished i18n framework + support for dutch (nl) language
    * 13 new levels 
    * finish drag&drop of objects
    * new concept: PivotPoint makes hinges and such possible
    * new concept: PolyObject allows non-square objects
    * Many bug fixes and small improvements

Known bugs:
  * some images may have 'garbage' on their borders during play.
    this is harmless but may be confusing.

We thank our beta players for their comments on the playability of the levels.

We would love to hear your thoughts and comments about the game!
