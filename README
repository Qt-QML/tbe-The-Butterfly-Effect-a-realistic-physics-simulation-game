Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", Milestone 5.

This is a fully playable game, but no yet completely finished.

There are 13 levels.
All levels are playable, some levels may need a bit more polish.

You need to have at least QT 4.4 installed to run the game.

We are aware that some levels (most importantly "house of cards")
consume a lot of CPU power in rendering. 
This will be addressed in a future milestone.

Other known bugs:
  * dragging objects back to the ToolBox does not work yet
  * level "Coconut instead of Coke" may crash
  * the coke bottle in  "Coconut instead of Coke" may disappear
  * dragging some objects leaves visual artefacts - these are harmless.
  * various balls may look a bit odd and may not be round

A very *rudimentary* level editor is available when you edit src/main.cpp line 30
to read " = true;" However, don't expect magic: most of the levels were
created with little help of the editor: we mostly hacked the XML directly.

We would love to hear your thoughts and comments about the game!
