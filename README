Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", Milestone 7.

This is a fully playable game, but no yet completely finished.
With this Milestone 7, we promote the game from alpha to beta quality.

If you downloaded the source archive - please refer to the file INSTALLING
to learn how to turn the sources into a working game.

If you downloaded the installer, you now have an icon on your desktop: 
enjoy the game!

There are 30 levels.
All levels are playable, some levels may need a bit more polish.

New features & highlights in Milestone 7:
    * serious performance improvements - usually around 300%
    * 4 new levels
    * more i18n support 
    * installer images for 32-bit and 64-bit Linux, using static
      builds of QT - validated to work on various Linux distros
    * Many bug fixes and small improvements

Known bugs:
  * Some images may have 'garbage' on their borders during play.
    this is harmless but may be confusing.
  * The level editor is unusable

We thank our beta players for their comments on the playability of the levels.

We would love to hear your thoughts and comments about the game!
