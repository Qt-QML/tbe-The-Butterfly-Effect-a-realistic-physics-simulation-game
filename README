Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", working up to Milestone A.

**************************************

This is a fully playable game of beta quality, well on its way to a shiny
1.0 release. For anyone who has played earlier versions of the game, you'll
notice a shiny new user interface - but the same levels and objects.

You can download the game at its website, 
go to          http://the-butterfly-effect.org/

If you downloaded the source archive - please refer to the file INSTALLING
to learn how to turn the sources into a working game and RUNNING on how
to run the game.

If you downloaded the installer, you now have an icon on your desktop: 
just (double-)click it to enjoy the game.

There are 40 levels.
All levels are playable, a few levels may need a bit more polish.

New features & highlights in Milestone A:
    * a shiny new GUI, which should also work with touchscreens and touchpads
    * several animations, making it more into a game
    * 50 frames per second on some machines
    * many playability fixes in levels

Why did this release take so long?
Rewriting the UI took a lot of time, as it is not an easy thing to do when you are this far into development.
If you don't believe: ask the KDE and Gnome teams!

The Level Creator
Unfortunately, in order to bring you the new player GUI we've decided to skip the Level Creator for now.
It will be back soon!

Alternative solutions
If you feel you found a solution to a level that is not right, please file
a ticket against it or mail the level mailing list. More info is availble in the 
Help menus.

Running in English, Dutch or Spanish
We promise again to make this selectable in the UI for the next milestone 
(see ticket:83).
However, if you need to change language, start TBE from the command line and
type:
   LANG="nl" ./tbe
Of course, for English you use "en" and for spanish "es".

Known bugs and issues:
  * The installers do not install into the "start menu", ticket:97
  * No Level Creator


We thank our beta players for their comments on the playability of the levels.
Especially: * All attendees at ELCE 2009 and T-Dose 2010,
