Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", Milestone 8.

This is a fully playable game of beta quality, well on its way to a shiny
1.0 release. For anyone who has played earlier versions of the game, you'll
notice several new levels, a much improved user interface and a level creator!

You can download the game at its website, 
go to          http://the-butterfly-effect.org/

If you downloaded the source archive - please refer to the file INSTALLING
to learn how to turn the sources into a working game and RUNNING on how
to run the game.

If you downloaded the installer, you now have an icon on your desktop: 
just (double-)click it to enjoy the game.

There are 35 levels.
All levels are playable, a few levels may need a bit more polish.

New features & highlights in Milestone 8:
    * Level Creator - see below
    * 6 new levels, 
      introducing the following new objects:
      - Balloon
      - Cactus (pops Balloon)
      - Bed of Nails (also pops Balloon)
      - Link (to connect two objects)
      - Translation Joint (limits movement to 1 axis, prevents rotation)
      - the ability to put a torque and/or speed on a PivotPoint
    * Many fixes to the usability of the user interface
    * Partial translations into Spanish


The Level Creator
This is a new feature of TBE. You can now adapt the existing levels or create your own.
Currently the Level Creator is still a bit rough on the edges. If you have never worked with
CAD applications, it may not be your cup of tea yet - but please try!
We are writing a manual for the Level Creator in our wiki:
https://sf.net/apps/trac/tbe/wiki/LevelCreator

Known bugs and issues:
  * Some images may have a 'garbage line ' on one or more borders during play.
    This is harmless but may be confusing. ticket:89
  * The installers do not install into the "start menu", ticket:97
  * The Level Creator isn't finished, nor really polished yet.
    The manual of the Level Creator discusses the limitations, 
    tickets 132, 147, 149, 151, 171, 177, 178 and others.


We thank our beta players for their comments on the playability of the levels.

We would love to hear your thoughts and comments about the game!
