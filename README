Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", Milestone 4.

This is not entirely a playable game yet.

As of October 16, 2009, the game is playable 'under supervision': 
  * there are 7 separate puzzles in the levels/elce09 directory
  * but there is no code for winning a level yet
The Butterfly effect was run as part of the end presentation of the Embedded 
Linux Conference Europe 2009 in Grenoble, where Klaas was hosting the game
on the podium and the audience could play in turns.

Please refer to the TODO file to see how far the development has to 
proceeded since to make it playable.

Regards,

Peter van Ginneken and Klaas van Gend
