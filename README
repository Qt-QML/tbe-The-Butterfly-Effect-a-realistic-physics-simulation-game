Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", Milestone 4.

This is not entirely a playable game yet.

As of October 16, 2009, the game is playable 'under supervision': 
  * there are 7 separate puzzles polished enough to play 
  * but there is no code for winning a level yet
The Butterfly effect was run as part of the end presentation of the Embedded 
Linux Conference Europe 2009 in Grenoble, where Klaas was hosting the game
on the podium and the audience could play in turns.

This milestone extends slightly beyondn that, because it contains a few bug
fixes, a level choose dialog and it is no longer possible to move predefined
objects.

A *rudimentary* level editor is available when you edit src/main.cpp line 30
to read " = true;" However, don't expect magic: most of the levels were
created with some help of the editor only: it was mostly hacking XML directly.


Regards,

Peter van Ginneken and Klaas van Gend
