Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect", Milestone 7.

This is a fully playable game, but no yet completely finished.
With this Milestone 7, we promote the game from alpha to beta quality.

If you downloaded the source archive - please refer to the file INSTALLING
to learn how to turn the sources into a working game and RUNNING on how
to run the game.

If you downloaded the installer, you now have an icon on your desktop: 
just (double-)click it to enjoy the game.

There are 30 levels.
All levels are playable, a few levels may need a bit more polish.

New features & highlights in Milestone 7:
    * Serious performance improvements - usually around 300%
    * 4 new levels
    * More i18n, now including level titles and items
    * Installer images for 32-bit and 64-bit Linux, using static
      builds of QT - validated to work on various Linux distros
    * Many bug fixes and small improvements

Known bugs:
  * Some images may have 'garbage' on their borders during play.
    This is harmless but may be confusing. ticket:89
  * The level editor is unusable. ticket:69, ticket:46
  * The installers do not install into the "start menu", ticket:97

We thank our beta players for their comments on the playability of the levels.

We would love to hear your thoughts and comments about the game!
