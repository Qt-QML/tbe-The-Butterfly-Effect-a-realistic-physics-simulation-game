RATIONALE BEHIND THE 3rdParty DIRECTORY
=======================================

The 3rdParty directory contains libraries and other parts that are
required for building The Butterfly Effect and are not usually 
available on systems - or where versioning is important.


Box2D  -    http://box2d.sourceforge.net/
A physics library for TBE.
Many distributions do not ship this library, and/or are 
shipping outdated or malfunctioning versions. The Butterfly Effect 
links statically against the library.
Originally we built a static version of the library, nowadays we just
take the sources from the archive and put them in src/box2d.
The Makefile has a target to redo that directory.


QT -        http://qt.nokia.com/
Even though QT is shipped by many distributions, we want to
be sure - we link against a static QT build in our release builds.


InstallJammer  http:///www.installjammer.com/
We use InstallJammer to build our installers.
