RATIONALE BEHIND THE 3rdParty DIRECTORY
=======================================

The 3rdParty directory contains libraries and other parts that are
required for building The Butterfly Effect and are not usually 
available on systems - or where versioning is important.


Box2D  -    http://box2d.sourceforge.net/
A physics library for TBE.
Many distributions do not ship this library, and/or are 
shipping outdated or malfunctioning versions. The Butterfly Effect 
links statically against the library.


QT -        http://qt.nokia.com/
Even though QT is shipped by many distributions, we want to
be sure - we link against a static QT build in our release builds.
