RATIONALE BEHIND THE 3rdParty DIRECTORY
=======================================

The 3rdParty directory contains libraries and other parts that are
required for building The Butterfly Effect and are not usually 
available on systems - or where versioning is important.


ode    -    http://opende.sourceforge.net/
Many distributions do not ship this library, and/or are shipping
outdated or malfunctioning versions. The Butterfly Effect links
statically against the library - and does not use features like
drawstuff.


Box2D  -    http://box2d.sourceforge.net/
Another physics library - a replacement of ode which isn't a great
fit for TBE.
Again, many distributions do not ship this library, and/or are 
shipping outdated or malfunctioning versions. The Butterfly Effect 
links statically against the library.
