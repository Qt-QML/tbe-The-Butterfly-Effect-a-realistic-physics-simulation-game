#Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect"
This is Milestone A (also known as the '0.9.2' release)

This is a fully playable game of beta quality, well on its way to a shiny
1.0 release. For anyone who has played earlier versions of the game, you'll
notice a shiny new user interface - but the same levels and objects.

You can download the game at its website, 
go to          http://the-butterfly-effect.org/

If you downloaded the source archive - please refer to the file INSTALLING
to learn how to turn the sources into a working game and RUNNING on how
to run the game.

If you downloaded the installer, you now have an icon on your desktop: 
just (double-)click it to enjoy the game.

There are 45 levels.
All levels are playable, a few levels may need a bit more polish.

###New features & highlights in Milestone A:
 * a shiny new GUI, which should also work with touchscreens and touchpads
 * several animations, making it more into a game
 * 60 frames per second on many machines
 * many playability fixes in levels
 * simulation accuracy fixes, so sims run the same across platforms
 * levels are automatically tested to ensure they work across platforms
 * development moved from Sourceforge to Github

###Why did this release take so long?
Rewriting the UI took a lot of time, as it is not an easy thing to do when you
are this far into development.
If you don't believe: ask the KDE and Gnome teams!

We have tried several UI approaches, but every time playtesting showed that
our ideas were nonintuitive to players. At some point we just ran out of ideas!

###The Level Creator
Unfortunately, in order to bring you the new player GUI we've decided to skip
the Level Creator for now. It will be back soon(ish)!

###Alternative solutions
If you feel you found a solution to a level that is not right, please post an
issue on github: https://github.com/kaa-ching/tbe/issues. 
More info is also availble in the TBE Help menus.

###Running in English, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Malay
If you want to change language, start TBE from the command line and
type:
> `LANG="nl" ./tbe`

Of course, for English you use "en", for spanish "es" and for Russian "ru".

###Known bugs and issues:
  * No Level Creator
  * Pareon Verify lists various bugs that cause random crashes
  * Levels do not behave the same on all platforms
