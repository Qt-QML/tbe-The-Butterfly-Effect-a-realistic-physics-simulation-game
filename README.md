#Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect"
This is Milestone B (also known as the '0.9.3' release)

If you want to know the current status, please look at
https://github.com/the-butterfly-effect/tbe/milestones/Milestone%20B

This is a fully playable game of beta quality, well on its way to a shiny
1.0 release. 

You can download the game at its website, 
go to          http://the-butterfly-effect.org/

If you downloaded the source archive - please refer to the file INSTALLING.md
to learn how to turn the sources into a working game and RUNNING.md on how
to run the game.

If you downloaded the installer, you now have an icon on your desktop: 
just (double-)click it to enjoy the game.

There are 76 levels.
All 63 levels up to and including "Find the Message" are definitely playable, 
a few levels may need a bit more polish. 
The levels after "Find the Message" are harder levels, play at your own risk!


###New features & highlights in Milestone B:
 * the Level Creator works (mostly)
 * many playability fixes in levels
 * over 20 new levels
 * many new languages, plus the ability to switch language on-the-fly
 * new objects, including the Pingus, cardboard box, and Seesaw
 * switch to Qt5 for the UI, making the game more "future proof"
 * visual improvements to existing levels

 
###Alternative solutions
If you feel you found a solution to a level that is not right, please post an
issue on github: https://github.com/the-butterfly-effect/tbe/issues. 
More info is also availble in the TBE Help menus.
We plan to add a 'save my solution' option in Milestone C.


###Running in other languages
If you want to change language, start TBE from the command line and
type:
> `LANGUAGE="nl" ./tbe`

Of course, for German you use "de", for spanish "es" and for Russian "ru".

Aternatively, you can switch language through the menu "Languages".


###Known bugs and issues:
  * we are not happy with the current UI, this is the major item for Milestone C.
  * you will crash the level creator if you enter bogus text in the object editor.
