# Welcome to "The Butterfly Effect"
The Butterfly Effect is a free and open source game that uses realistic physics
simulations to combine lots of simple mechanical elements to achieve a simple
goal in the most complex way possible.

This is a fully playable game of beta quality, well on its way to a shiny
1.0 release.

## Features

* Many different objects: cola bottles, balloons, butterflies, domino stones,
  springs, dynamite, seesaws, penguins
* Many different types of puzzles
* Works on GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS
* Playable in English, Dutch, German, Russian, French, Danish, Swedish, Turkish,
  Ukrainian and several other languages. Note that not all languages are 100% yet
* Using vector graphics - all images always rendered at the highest quality
* Roughly 70 levels

## Development status

We are working on Milestone C (also known as the '0.9.4' release).

THIS IS THE BRANCH CONTAINING THE "OLD" USER INTERFACE!
We are working to replace the user interface, it is available on a different branch.

If you want to know the current status, please look at
https://github.com/the-butterfly-effect/tbe/milestones/Milestone%20C

You can download the game at its website,
go to <http://the-butterfly-effect.org/>.

### New features and highlights planned for Milestone C

* New UI
* We plan to add a 'save my solution' option in Milestone C
* More reliable level creator

## Installation

If you downloaded the source archive - please refer to the file `INSTALLING.md`
to learn how to turn the sources into a working game and `RUNNING.md` on how
to run the game.

If you downloaded the installer, you now have an icon on your desktop:
just (double-)click it to enjoy the game.

## Playing

There are 76 levels.
All levels up to and including "Find the Message" are definitely playable,
a few levels may need a bit more polish.
The levels after "Find the Message" are harder levels, play at your own risk!

### Alternative solutions

If you feel you found a solution to a level that is not right, please post an
issue on GitHub: https://github.com/the-butterfly-effect/tbe/issues.

### Running in other languages

If you want to change language, select a language through the menu "Languages".
You need to restart after doing this.

Alternatively, you can start TBE from the command line and type:

> `LANGUAGE="nl" ./tbe`

Of course, for German you use "de", for spanish "es" and for Russian "ru".

## Known bugs and issues

* We are not happy with the current UI, this is the major item for Milestone C.
* You will crash the level creator if you enter bogus text in the object editor.
