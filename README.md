# The Butterfly Effect-site

This branch contains the code for the site of [The Butterfly Effect](http://the-butterfly-effect.org).

## Requirements

We are using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), therefor you need to do a few things before
you can create your own development environment.
 
1. ruby-devel: `apt-get install ruby-dev` or `yum install ruby-devel`
2. github-pages gem (implies the jekyll gem): `gem install --user-install github-pages`
