# The Butterfly Effect-site

This branch contains the code for the site of [The Butterfly Effect](http://the-butterfly-effect.org).

## Developing the site

We are using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), therefor you need to do a few things before
you can create your own development environment.
 
1. ruby-devel => 2.0: `apt-get install ruby-dev` or `yum install ruby-devel`
2. github-pages gem (implies the jekyll gem): `gem install --user-install github-pages`

Note: the above doesn't work for Ubuntu 14.04: it comes with a too old version of ruby. 
There is a package `ruby2-dev` available in the `trusty-updates` repository, though.

If you don't have the whole project cloned and just want to work on the site,
clone the branch: `git clone https://github.com/the-butterfly-effect/tbe -b gh-pages --single-branch tbe`

Get another terminal, where you run `jekyll serve --base-url` (leave base-url empty). Visit your
clone at http://localhost:4000 - leave the terminal open.

In your other terminal, make your changes and save the file when you're done. It gets automatically
generated by the jekyll process you have running.

## Syntax for content

The syntax of the content must be written in [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).
It provides us more possibilities when composing pages.

Currently the style to write pages is as follows:

 * Do not enter line-break unless intentional. Jekyll converts them automatically to hard returns.
 * Don't use tabs, but spaces. Every indentation is four spaces.
 * Avoid using HTML as much as possible in the .md files

We use [bootstrap3](https://getbootstrap.com) primarily for CSS, not so much for JS - except for
the lightbox (used for the screenshots).

## Questions?

Just ask @DjSlash. :)
