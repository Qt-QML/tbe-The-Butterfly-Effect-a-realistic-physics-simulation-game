The Butterfly Effect

The application can be run from the command line:
    ./tbe

If you used an installer, it can also be run through the Desktop shortcut.

If you want TBE to run in a different language (and the support is present)
you can force this by typing this:
    LANG="nl" ./tbe



At the moment, TBE accepts only one argument: a level to start immediately.
