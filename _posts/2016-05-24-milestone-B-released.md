Hi!

Today we released _Milestone B_ on [github.com](github.com). It is meant as a first feature release, containing a few new features:

 * make the level creator work again and actually usable (read the README!)
 * several new objects, including [Pingus](/blog/2015/12/26/new-object-pingus), Cardboard Box, and Seesaw
 * more than 20 new levels, plus fixing all existing ones
 * switch to Qt5
 * run-time switching between languages
 * translations now also available for levels
 * fixing many many inconsistencies and small issues
 * OS X support, but for now only works on OS X El Capitan

According to the github issue tracker, 90 issues were handled as part of the development, where an issue can be a small bug or something along the lines of "make the level editor work again".



[Next up is Milestone C](https://github.com/the-butterfly-effect/tbe/milestones/), in which we plan to overhaul the UI yet again.
