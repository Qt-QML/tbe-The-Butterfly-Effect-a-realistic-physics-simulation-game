For a while now, the TBE developers have been gathering on IRC.

IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is a very robust chat communication mechanism. Everyone can join, ask questions and get answers in real time. We have set up camp on a chat server called [freenode.net](freenode.net) in the channel **#tbe**.

Of course, we'd love to see you join our channel - as long as you want to discuss the game *The Butterfly Effect*, of course.

### Some IRC chat applications
There are many applications to connect to IRC, just google around if you need one. There are also apps for iOS and Android, but in our experience those tend to logout pretty quickly when you are inactive - which is annoying.

All TBE developers use open source IRC clients:

* [hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/), for many platforms, GUI
* [colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) for MacOSX
* [weechat](https://weechat.org/), for many platforms, but text only
* [kopete](https://userbase.kde.org/Kopete), for KDE


### Easy: use a web interface for IRC
If you don't want to bother with installing a special IRC,
a simple entry would be to use one of the free/libre web-based chat clients:

* [Kiwi IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#tbe), this will automatically log you in
* [Freenode's own webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/) is a bit more bare-bone. Please log in to channel #tbe.


### Special user: Post-ItBoy

One of the users on the channel is *Post-ItBoy*, you know: the guy who writes the post-its in the game.
Actually, this is a bot (operated by user *DjSlash* ) that monitors our github project. 
Our dear Post-ItBoy will post a line for anything that changes on github, like issues, commits or pull requests.
So a developer only has to read up on IRC to be on top of all discussions and the changes of the project. 
That's called convenience!



**We hope to see you on IRC!**
