Hi!

Today we released _Milestone A_, the first milestone of _The Butterfly Effect_ under the new &eacute;lan on [github.com]. It is meant as a maintenance release, ''let's polish and release what we have now''.

 *  New UI compared to milestone-9 (actually, the UI was fully overhauled twice)
 *  UI is more polished: all in-game dialogs have 'skins'
 *  More languages and more things (e.g. object tooltips, levels) are translated.
 *  Much more levels - but we need to test if all levels still work
 *  Automated testing of various levels to help ensure that the games runs the same on all platforms
 *  Disabled level editor - it is too broken to release

[Next up is Milestone B](https://github.com/the-butterfly-effect/tbe/milestones/), which we plan to have one new major object, several new levels and the level editor will be enabled again.
